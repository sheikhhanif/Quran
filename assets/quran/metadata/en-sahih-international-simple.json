He said, \"O my people, these are my daughters; they are purer for you. So fear Allāh and do not disgrace me concerning my guests.

Upon Him I have relied, and to Him I return."},"11:89":{"t":"And O my people, let not [your] dissension from me cause you to be struck by that similar to what struck the people of Noah or the people of Hūd or the people of Ṣāliḥ. And the people of Lot are not from you far away."},"11:90":{"t":"And ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him. Indeed, my Lord is Merciful and Affectionate.\""},"11:91":{"t":"They said, \"O Shuʿayb, we do not understand much of what you say, and indeed, we consider you among us as weak.

And they were not availed at all by their gods which they invoked other than Allāh when there came the command of your Lord. And they did not increase them in other than ruin."},"11:102":{"t":"And thus is the seizure of your Lord when He seizes the cities while they are committing wrong. Indeed, His seizure is painful and severe."},"11:103":{"t":"Indeed in that is a sign for those who fear the punishment of the Hereafter. That is a Day for which the people will be collected, and that is a Day [which will be] witnessed."},"11:104":{"t":"And We do not delay it except for a limited term."},"11:105":{"t":"The Day it comes no soul will speak except by His permission.

That is a reminder for those who remember."},"11:115":{"t":"And be patient, for indeed, Allāh does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good."},"11:116":{"t":"So why were there not among the generations before you those of enduring discrimination forbidding corruption on earth - except a few of those We saved from among them? But those who wronged pursued what luxury they were given therein, and they were criminals."},"11:117":{"t":"And your Lord would not have destroyed the cities unjustly while their people were reformers."},"11:118":{"t":"And if your Lord had willed, He could have made mankind one community; but they will not cease to differ,"},"11:119":{"t":"Except whom your Lord has given mercy, and for that He created them.

And Allāh is the one sought for help against that which you describe.\""},"12:19":{"t":"And there came a company of travelers; then they sent their water drawer, and he let down his bucket. He said, \"Good news! Here is a boy.\" And they concealed him, [taking him] as merchandise; and Allāh was Knowing of what they did."},"12:20":{"t":"And they sold him for a reduced price - a few dirhams - and they were, concerning him, of those content with little."},"12:21":{"t":"And the one from Egypt who bought him said to his wife, \"Make his residence comfortable. Perhaps he will benefit us, or we will adopt him as a son.\" And thus, We established Joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpretation of events [i.e., dreams]. And Allāh is predominant over His affair, but most of the people do not know."},"12:22":{"t":"And when he [i.e., Joseph] reached maturity, We gave him judgement and knowledge. And thus We reward the doers of good."},"12:23":{"t":"And she, in whose house he was, sought to seduce him. She closed the doors and said, \"Come, you.\" He said, \"[I seek] the refuge of Allāh. Indeed, he is my master, who has made good my residence. Indeed, wrongdoers will not succeed.\""},"12:24":{"t":"And she certainly determined [to seduce] him, and he would have inclined to her had he not seen the proof [i.e., sign] of his Lord. And thus [it was] that We should avert from him evil and immorality. Indeed, he was of Our chosen servants."},"12:25":{"t":"And they both raced to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back, and they found her husband at the door.

This is not a man; this is none but a noble angel.\""},"12:32":{"t":"She said, \"That is the one about whom you blamed me.

The matter has been decreed about which you both inquire.\""},"12:42":{"t":"And he said to the one whom he knew would go free, \"Mention me before your master.\" But Satan made him forget the mention [to] his master, and he [i.e., Joseph] remained in prison several years."},"12:43":{"t":"And [subsequently] the king said, \"Indeed, I have seen [in a dream] seven fat cows being eaten by seven [that were] lean, and seven green spikes [of grain] and others [that were] dry.

They said, \"O our father, what [more] could we desire? This is our merchandise returned to us. And we will obtain supplies [i.e., food] for our family and protect our brother and obtain an increase of a camel's load; that is an easy measurement.\""},"12:66":{"t":"[Jacob] said, \"Never will I send him with you until you give me a promise [i.e., oath] by Allāh that you will bring him [back] to me, unless you should be surrounded [i.e., overcome by enemies].\" And when they had given their promise, he said, \"Allāh, over what we say, is Entrusted.\""},"12:67":{"t":"And he said, \"O my sons, do not enter from one gate but enter from different gates; and I cannot avail you against [the decree of] Allāh at all. The decision is only for Allāh; upon Him I have relied, and upon Him let those who would rely [indeed] rely.\""},"12:68":{"t":"And when they entered from where their father had ordered them, it did not avail them against Allāh at all except [it was] a need [i.e., concern] within the soul of Jacob, which he satisfied. And indeed, he was a possessor of knowledge because of what We had taught him, but most of the people do not know."},"12:69":{"t":"And when they entered upon Joseph, he took his brother to himself; he said, \"Indeed, I am your brother, so do not despair over what they used to do [to me].\""},"12:70":{"t":"So when he had furnished them with their supplies, he put the [gold measuring] bowl into the bag of his brother. Then an announcer called out, \"O caravan, indeed you are thieves.\""},"12:71":{"t":"They said while approaching them, \"What is it you are missing?\""},"12:72":{"t":"They said, \"We are missing the measure of the king. And for he who produces it is [the reward of] a camel's load, and I am responsible for it.\""},"12:73":{"t":"They said, \"By Allāh, you have certainly known that we did not come to cause corruption in the land, and we have not been thieves.\""},"12:74":{"t":"They [the accusers] said, \"Then what would be its recompense if you should be liars?\""},"12:75":{"t":"[The brothers] said, \"Its recompense is that he in whose bag it is found - he [himself] will be its recompense. Thus do we recompense the wrongdoers.\""},"12:76":{"t":"So he began [the search] with their bags before the bag of his brother; then he extracted it from the bag of his brother. Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not have taken his brother within the religion [i.e., law] of the king except that Allāh willed. We raise in degrees whom We will, but over every possessor of knowledge is one [more] knowing."},"12:77":{"t":"They said, \"If he steals - a brother of his has stolen before.\" But Joseph kept it within himself and did not reveal it to them. He said, \"You are worse in position, and Allāh is most knowing of what you describe.\""},"12:78":{"t":"They said, \"O ʿAzeez, indeed he has a father [who is] an old man, so take one of us in place of him. Indeed, we see you as a doer of good.\""},"12:79":{"t":"He said, \"[I seek] the refuge of Allāh [to prevent] that we take except him with whom we found our possession. Indeed, we would then be unjust.\""},"12:80":{"t":"So when they had despaired of him, they secluded themselves in private consultation. The eldest of them said, \"Do you not know that your father has taken upon you an oath by Allāh and [that] before you failed in [your duty to] Joseph? So I will never leave [this] land until my father permits me or Allāh decides for me, and He is the best of judges."},"12:81":{"t":"Return to your father and say, 'O our father, indeed your son has stolen, and we did not testify except to what we knew. And we were not witnesses of the unseen."},"12:82":{"t":"And ask the city in which we were and the caravan in which we came - and indeed, we are truthful.'\""},"12:83":{"t":"[Jacob] said, \"Rather, your souls have enticed you to something, so patience is most fitting. Perhaps Allāh will bring them to me all together. Indeed, it is He who is the Knowing, the Wise.\""},"12:84":{"t":"And he turned away from them and said, \"Oh, my sorrow over Joseph,\" and his eyes became white from grief, for he was [of that] a suppressor."},"12:85":{"t":"They said, \"By Allāh, you will not cease remembering Joseph until you become fatally ill or become of those who perish.\""},"12:86":{"t":"He said, \"I only complain of my suffering and my grief to Allāh, and I know from Allāh that which you do not know."},"12:87":{"t":"O my sons, go and find out about Joseph and his brother and despair not of relief from Allāh. Indeed, no one despairs of relief from Allāh except the disbelieving people.\""},"12:88":{"t":"So when they entered upon him [i.e., Joseph], they said, \"O ʿAzeez, adversity has touched us and our family, and we have come with goods poor in quality, but give us full measure and be charitable to us. Indeed, Allāh rewards the charitable.\""},"12:89":{"t":"He said, \"Do you know what you did with Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant?\""},"12:90":{"t":"They said, \"Are you indeed Joseph?\" He said, \"I am Joseph, and this is my brother. Allāh has certainly favored us. Indeed, he who fears Allāh and is patient, then indeed, Allāh does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good.\""},"12:91":{"t":"They said, \"By Allāh, certainly has Allāh preferred you over us, and indeed, we have been sinners.\""},"12:92":{"t":"He said, \"No blame will there be upon you today. May Allāh forgive you; and He is the most merciful of the merciful."},"12:93":{"t":"Take this, my shirt, and cast it over the face of my father; he will become seeing. And bring me your family, all together.\""},"12:94":{"t":"And when the caravan departed [from Egypt], their father said, \"Indeed, I find the smell of Joseph [and would say that he was alive] if you did not think me weakened in mind.\""},"12:95":{"t":"They said, \"By Allāh, indeed you are in your [same] old error.\""},"12:96":{"t":"And when the bearer of good tidings arrived, he cast it over his face, and he returned [once again] seeing. He said, \"Did I not tell you that I know from Allāh that which you do not know?\""},"12:97":{"t":"They said, \"O our father, ask for us forgiveness of our sins; indeed, we have been sinners.\""},"12:98":{"t":"He said, \"I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\""},"12:99":{"t":"And when they entered upon Joseph, he took his parents to himself [i.e., embraced them] and said, \"Enter Egypt, Allāh willing, safe [and secure].\""},"12:100":{"t":"And he raised his parents upon the throne, and they bowed to him in prostration. And he said, \"O my father, this is the explanation of my vision of before. My Lord has made it reality. And He was certainly good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you [here] from bedouin life after Satan had induced [estrangement] between me and my brothers. Indeed, my Lord is Subtle in what He wills. Indeed, it is He who is the Knowing, the Wise."},"12:101":{"t":"My Lord, You have given me [something] of sovereignty and taught me of the interpretation of dreams. Creator of the heavens and earth, You are my protector in this world and the Hereafter. Cause me to die a Muslim and join me with the righteous.\""},"12:102":{"t":"That is from the news of the unseen which We reveal, [O Muḥammad], to you. And you were not with them when they put together their plan while they conspired."},"12:103":{"t":"And most of the people, although you strive [for it], are not believers."},"12:104":{"t":"And you do not ask of them for it any payment. It is not except a reminder to the worlds."},"12:105":{"t":"And how many a sign within the heavens and earth do they pass over while they, therefrom, are turning away."},"12:106":{"t":"And most of them believe not in Allāh except while they associate others with Him."},"12:107":{"t":"Then do they feel secure that there will not come to them an overwhelming [aspect] of the punishment of Allāh or that the Hour will not come upon them suddenly while they do not perceive?"},"12:108":{"t":"Say, \"This is my way; I invite to Allāh with insight, I and those who follow me.

These are the verses of the Book; and what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, but most of the people do not believe."},"13:2":{"t":"It is Allāh who erected the heavens without pillars that you [can] see; then He established Himself above the Throne and made subject the sun and the moon, each running [its course] for a specified term.

But the disbelievers will have a severe punishment."},"42:27":{"t":"And if Allāh had extended [excessively] provision for His servants, they would have committed tyranny throughout the earth. But He sends [it] down in an amount which He wills. Indeed He is, of His servants, Aware and Seeing."},"42:28":{"t":"And it is He who sends down the rain after they had despaired and spreads His mercy.

Indeed, He does not like wrongdoers."},"42:41":{"t":"And whoever retaliates after having been wronged - those have not upon them any cause [for blame]."},"42:42":{"t":"The cause is only against the ones who wrong the people and tyrannize upon the earth without right. Those will have a painful punishment."},"42:43":{"t":"And whoever is patient and forgives - indeed, that is of the matters [worthy] of resolve."},"42:44":{"t":"And he whom Allāh sends astray - for him there is no protector beyond Him. And you will see the wrongdoers, when they see the punishment, saying, \"Is there for return [to the former world] any way?\""},"42:45":{"t":"And you will see them being exposed to it [i.e., the Fire], humbled from humiliation, looking from [behind] a covert glance.

That is because they have denied Our signs and they were heedless of them."},"7:147":{"t":"Those who denied Our signs and the meeting of the Hereafter - their deeds have become worthless. Are they recompensed except for what they used to do?"},"7:148":{"t":"And the people of Moses made, after [his departure], from their ornaments a calf - an image having a lowing sound.
