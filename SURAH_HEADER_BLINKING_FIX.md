# Surah Header Blinking Fix

## Problem
The surah name header was blinking when playing audio or changing pages because the `SurahBanner` widget used a `FutureBuilder` that would rebuild and show a loading state every time the parent widget called `setState()`.

## Root Cause
1. **FutureBuilder Rebuilding**: Every time audio played or pages changed, `setState()` was called
2. **Loading State**: The `FutureBuilder` would show a loading state before displaying the content
3. **Font Loading**: Font and ligatures were being loaded on every rebuild

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Removed FutureBuilder**
- Replaced `FutureBuilder` with direct widget rendering
- Font and ligatures are now loaded statically and cached
- No more loading states during rebuilds

### 2. **Static Font Loading**
```dart
static bool _surahHeaderFontLoaded = false;
static Map<String, String>? _ligatures;
static bool _isInitializing = false;
```

### 3. **Preloading at Startup**
```dart
// Preload surah header font and ligatures
await SurahBanner.preload();
```

### 4. **StatefulWidget for Stability**
- Converted from `StatelessWidget` to `StatefulWidget`
- Better state management and fewer unnecessary rebuilds

### 5. **Immediate Glyph Access**
```dart
// Get glyph immediately if data is already loaded
final glyph = _ligatures != null ? _glyphForSurah(widget.surahNumber) : null;
```

## Key Changes

### **Before (Blinking):**
```dart
return FutureBuilder(
  future: _ensureFontAndLigaturesLoaded(),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    final hasData = snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done;
    final glyph = hasData ? _glyphForSurah(surahNumber) : null;
    // Shows loading state on every rebuild
  },
);
```

### **After (No Blinking):**
```dart
// Get glyph immediately if data is already loaded
final glyph = _ligatures != null ? _glyphForSurah(widget.surahNumber) : null;

// If data is not loaded yet, show fallback only once
if (_ligatures == null && !_isInitializing) {
  _ensureFontAndLigaturesLoaded();
  return fallbackWidget;
}

// Direct rendering with cached data
return flutterFallback();
```

## Benefits

✅ **No more blinking** during audio playback
✅ **No more blinking** during page changes
✅ **Faster rendering** with preloaded fonts
✅ **Stable display** with cached ligatures
✅ **Better performance** with static loading
✅ **Smooth user experience** without visual glitches

## Loading Sequence

1. **Startup**: Font and ligatures preloaded during initialization
2. **First Display**: Immediate rendering with cached data
3. **Subsequent Displays**: Instant rendering, no loading states
4. **Audio/Page Changes**: No rebuilds or loading states

## Technical Details

- **Font Loading**: Static, loaded once at startup
- **Ligatures**: Cached in memory, accessed immediately
- **Widget Type**: StatefulWidget for better state management
- **Rebuild Behavior**: No loading states during rebuilds
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal, fonts and ligatures cached once

The surah header now displays consistently without any blinking or loading states, providing a smooth and professional user experience.
